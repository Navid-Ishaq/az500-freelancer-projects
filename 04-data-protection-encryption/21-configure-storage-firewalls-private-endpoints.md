# 🛡️ Project 21: Configure Storage Account Firewalls and Private Endpoints

## 📌 Project Objective  
Configure **Azure Storage Account firewalls** and integrate **Private Endpoints** to ensure that access to your storage services is only possible from approved networks or private Azure virtual networks — not from the public internet.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Unrestricted public access to storage accounts is a major risk. By using **firewall rules** and **Private Endpoints**, you lock down access paths, helping ensure sensitive data remains protected and only reachable by trusted services.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Storage Account**  
- **Private Endpoint**  
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**  
- **Firewall and Virtual Network Rules**
