# 🛡️ Project 22: Implement Encryption-at-Rest Using Customer-Managed Keys

## 📌 Project Objective  
Implement **encryption-at-rest** for Azure resources using **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)** stored in **Azure Key Vault** to meet strict compliance and internal security requirements for data confidentiality.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
While Azure encrypts data at rest by default using platform-managed keys, organizations with regulatory or policy mandates often require full control of encryption keys. This project empowers businesses to bring their own key (BYOK) and monitor key usage.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Key Vault**  
- **Azure Storage / Azure Disk Encryption**  
- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)**  
- **Access Policies or RBAC on Key Vault**
