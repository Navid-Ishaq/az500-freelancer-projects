# 🛡️ Project 24: Set up Key Vault access policies & RBAC securely

## 📌 Project Objective  
Configure **Azure Key Vault** to restrict and manage access to secrets, keys, and certificates using a combination of **access policies** and **role-based access control (RBAC)** for granular permission enforcement.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Key Vault holds highly sensitive data — securing access ensures that only authorized users or services can retrieve or manage cryptographic material. This project helps enforce the principle of least privilege and supports strong governance and auditing practices.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Key Vault**  
- **Access Policies**  
- **Azure RBAC**  
- **Azure Active Directory**
