# 🛡️ Project 35: Script user access reviews using PowerShell / Azure CLI

## 📌 Project Objective  
Automate periodic **user access reviews** for Azure AD roles and group memberships using **PowerShell** or **Azure CLI scripts**. These scripts help list assignments, check last sign-in dates, and revoke unnecessary access.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Manual access audits are time-consuming. With scripting, organizations achieve **efficient, repeatable access governance** to maintain **least privilege principles** and meet compliance expectations like **ISO 27001 or SOC 2**.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Active Directory**
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell / Azure CLI**
- **Access Reviews / RBAC Reports**
- **Automation Accounts (Optional)**
