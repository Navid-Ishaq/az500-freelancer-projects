# 🛡️ Project 20: Set Up Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access to Limit Attack Surfaces

## 📌 Project Objective  
Enable **Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access** to control and reduce unnecessary exposure of virtual machines by allowing remote access only when needed, for a limited duration, and to authorized users.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Open management ports (like RDP or SSH) are a frequent entry point for attackers. JIT dramatically reduces the attack surface by only opening ports **on-demand**, limiting exposure while still supporting admin tasks.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**  
- **Azure Virtual Machines**  
- **JIT VM Access Policies**  
- **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
