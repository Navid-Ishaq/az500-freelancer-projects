# 🛡️ Project 41: Review and Configure Secure DevOps Pipelines with Secrets Scanning

## 📌 Project Objective  
Secure your Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions pipelines by reviewing configurations, implementing **secrets scanning**, and enforcing secure deployment practices — ensuring credentials and sensitive data don’t leak during CI/CD.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
DevOps pipelines are powerful but can become **security liabilities** if misconfigured. Secrets in code, insecure workflows, or unscanned repositories can lead to data breaches. This project helps you harden automation flows to protect the software supply chain.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure DevOps / GitHub**
- **Microsoft Defender for DevOps**
- **Azure Key Vault**
- **Secrets Detection Policies**
- **Pipeline Permissions & Role Review**
