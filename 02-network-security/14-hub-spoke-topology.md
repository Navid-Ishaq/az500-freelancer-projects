# 🧱 Project 14: Build Secure Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology

## 📌 Project Objective  
Design and deploy a **hub-and-spoke network architecture** in Azure to centralize security, routing, and network services while isolating workloads across different spokes.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Hub-and-spoke is a proven design for **scalable, secure, and segmented** cloud networks. It allows shared services like firewalls, VPN gateways, and DNS to be hosted in the hub, while **spokes remain isolated yet connected**. This enhances **control, compliance, and cost-efficiency** across enterprise cloud environments.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**  
- **VNet Peering**  
- **Azure Firewall / NVA (Network Virtual Appliances)**  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**  
- **Route Tables / UDRs (User Defined Routes)**
