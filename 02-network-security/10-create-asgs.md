# Task 10: Create Application Security Groups (ASGs) for Better Isolation

**Domain:** 02 - Network Security

This task covers creating **Application Security Groups (ASGs)** to simplify the management of network security rules. ASGs allow you to group VMs logically and apply NSG rules to those groups instead of IPs.

Real-world use: Great for microservices or tiered apps â€” group VMs by role and apply security policies that adapt as the environment scales.
