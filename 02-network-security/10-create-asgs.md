# 🧱 Project 10: Create Application Security Groups (ASGs) for Better Isolation

## 📌 Project Objective  
Create and apply **Application Security Groups (ASGs)** to logically group Azure virtual machines and define network security policies based on application roles rather than IP addresses. Simplify the management of NSG rules in dynamic environments.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
**ASGs** enable scalable and manageable **micro-segmentation** in Azure networks. Instead of updating IPs manually, you assign VM workloads to ASGs and write security rules once — making **security automation and isolation** easier, especially for **multi-tier architectures**.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Application Security Groups (ASGs)**  
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**  
- **Virtual Networks (VNets) & Subnets**
