# 🧱 Project 15: Conduct NSG Flow Log Reviews for Threat Detection

## 📌 Project Objective  
Enable and analyze **NSG (Network Security Group) flow logs** to detect suspicious traffic patterns and security risks across Azure virtual networks.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Flow logs provide visibility into network-level traffic, helping organizations **detect anomalies**, **track lateral movement**, and **identify misconfigurations**. Reviewing these logs supports **proactive threat detection** and strengthens network posture in cloud environments.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**  
- **NSG Flow Logs (via Azure Network Watcher)**  
- **Storage Account (for log storage)**  
- **Azure Monitor / Log Analytics**  
- **KQL (Kusto Query Language) for querying logs**
