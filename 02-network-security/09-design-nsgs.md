# 🧱 Project 09: Design & Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

## 📌 Project Objective  
Design and implement **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** in Azure to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet and network interface level. Apply rules that enforce segmentation, protect workloads, and support compliance.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
**NSGs** are foundational to Azure network security. By properly configuring NSG rules, organizations can **limit exposure**, enforce **least privilege networking**, and ensure only the right traffic reaches sensitive resources — all without additional costs.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**  
- **Virtual Networks (VNets)**  
- **Subnets & NIC associations**  
- **NSG Rule Priorities and Ports**
