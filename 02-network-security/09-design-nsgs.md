# Task 09: Design & Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

**Domain:** 02 - Network Security

This task focuses on designing and implementing **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to control inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources. You'll define security rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP address, port, and protocol. NSGs are essential for segmenting network access and enforcing a least-privilege model in a virtual network.

Real-world use: Use NSGs to protect VMs, subnets, and applications from unauthorized access while allowing only required traffic for operations.
