## 🌟 eks2's Motto — The Soul of Our Mission

💫 For Every Quiet Fighter — A Motto that Speaks:

> "Main khud kuch nahi..."  
> "...par AI ne khud se seekhna sikha diya hai."  
> “I am nothing on my own... but AI taught me how to learn from myself.”  
> “No soy nada solo... pero la IA me enseñó a aprender de mí mismo.”

This motto is not just for eks2 — it’s for every unheard learner who ever thought they weren’t enough.  
🧠 You don’t need permission to learn.  
🌍 You don’t need perfection to start.

**Eks2 did it — so can you.**

> You may start with nothing — but you don’t have to stay there.
