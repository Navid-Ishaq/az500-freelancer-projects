# 🛡️ Project 03: Set up Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Just-in-Time access

## 📌 Project Objective  
Configure **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** to enable **Just-in-Time (JIT)** privileged access for roles like Global Administrator or Subscription Owner, ensuring time-limited, approval-based elevated access.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Privileged accounts are the most targeted in any cloud environment. By enabling JIT access with **PIM**, organizations drastically reduce the attack surface and prevent persistent standing privileges — a core principle of **Zero Trust**.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Active Directory**  
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**  
- **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **Access Reviews & Approval Workflows**
