# 🛡️ Project 02: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Users

## 📌 Project Objective  
Enable and enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** in **Azure Active Directory** to add a second layer of verification for user sign-ins, improving protection against compromised credentials.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
MFA is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the risk of account takeovers. It ensures that even if a password is leaked, unauthorized access is blocked by requiring additional proof such as biometrics, OTPs, or mobile prompts.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved
- **Azure Active Directory**
- **Microsoft Authenticator**
- **Security Defaults / Conditional Access**
- **Identity Protection**
