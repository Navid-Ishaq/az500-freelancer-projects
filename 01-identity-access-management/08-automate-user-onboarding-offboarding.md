# 🛡️ Project 08: Automate User Onboarding/Offboarding with Access Packages

## 📌 Project Objective  
Use **Azure AD Access Packages** to automate and manage user onboarding and offboarding processes for internal teams and external partners — ensuring proper access is granted and revoked in a timely, auditable way.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Manual access assignments often lead to over-provisioning and security risks. **Access Packages** allow role-based provisioning through **Entitlement Management**, enabling dynamic, **approval-based access workflows** with automatic expiration and review.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Active Directory Identity Governance**  
- **Access Packages**  
- **Entitlement Management**  
- **Access Reviews**  
- **MyAccess Portal (End User Experience)**
