# 🛡️ Project 04: Review & Remediate Risky Sign-ins and Users

## 📌 Project Objective  
Investigate and respond to **risky user behavior** and **suspicious sign-in attempts** using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) security tools, minimizing exposure and preventing account compromise.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
Not all threats come from the outside — accounts exhibiting risky behavior could be under attack or misused. Monitoring **sign-in risk** and **user risk levels**, then acting on them, ensures **real-time identity protection** and forms a critical part of any cloud security posture.

## 🧰 Core Azure Services Involved  
- **Azure Active Directory / Microsoft Entra ID**  
- **Identity Protection**  
- **Risky Sign-ins**  
- **Risky Users Dashboard**  
- **Conditional Access (Risk-Based Policies)**
